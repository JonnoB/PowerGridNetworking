#' Find components of a graph that have changed
#' Find components of a graph that have changed

#' Using this should be able to cut down on the amount of calculation done on the power flow equations
#' This function checks to see which subcomponents have changed in the graph and which are the same.
#' It does this by comparing edges. This is because a component may have had an edge removed but still be intact.
#' However, the powerflow will still need to be re-calculated.
#' The function a scaler vector representing each of the changed components
#' @param g the current graph
#' @param g0 the previous graph
#' @param EdgeName A character string. The name of the edge attribute
