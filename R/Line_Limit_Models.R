#' Create line limits using a linear model trained on the UK grid
#'
#' These functions set the line limits of network using a model trained on the UK power grid
#' 
#'
#' @param g An igraph object representing a power grid. must have a power flow attribute.
#' @param PowerFlow The name of the graph attribute which contains the power flow over each line.
#' @param Voltage The name of the graph attribute which contains the Voltage. The attribute should be numeric.
#' @param Link.Limit The attribute name that will be used when setting the line limits.
#' @name Line_limits
#' 
#' @return The original network with an additional edge attribute that is a numeric line limit created by; Line Limit =  \eqn{a*PowerFlow + b*Voltage + c}
#'  
#' @details The models used here were trained on a network representing a simplified version UK high voltage network similar to that used in the 
#'     Electricity Ten Year Statement (ETYS) dataset. The model was validated using ten fold cross validation. In testing the Volt PF was a top 
#'     performer or the best performing model in all tests performed in the paper \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12848}{Bourne et al. 2019}. 
#'     The PF model generally performed well but not at the level of the Volt_PF model. 
#'     The Volt_PF model was trained using three difference voltage levels 132, 275 and 400Kv.
#'     The relationship between Voltage and log10 line limits appeared linear when correcting for power flow. However, we cannot say what will
#'     happen to the relationship at very high or very low voltage levels. The reccomended order in which artificial line limits should be used
#'     given available data is as follows.

#'   \item Line_Limit_Volt_PF
