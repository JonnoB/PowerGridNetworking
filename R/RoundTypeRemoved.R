#' Round Removed and Type of Removal
#'
#' This function finds the round removed of all Nodes and Edges in a network as well as whether the removal type was Targeted/Overloaded/Islanded
#'
#' The function accepts the list of lists produced by the function attack the grid and outputs a
#'     list containing two dataframes for Nodes and Edges respectively.
#'
#' @param AttackSeries The list of lists produced by attack the grid
#' @export
