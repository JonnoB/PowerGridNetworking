#' Summarise attack Statistics
#'
#'Sumamrises the attack statistics by extracting the information from
#'   the list of lists of graphs produced by the AttackTheGrid function.
#'
#' The function summarises the effect of the attack on the network providing statistics on,
#' Max component size, Total Nodes, Total Edges, Power Generated, Grid loading, Giant component fraction,
#' Blackout size.

#' @param NetworkList The output of the AttackTheGridFunction
#' @param Generation The name of the variable that stores the net generation data. character string
#' @param Edgename A character string. The default is "name".
#' @param PowerFlow A character String. The default is "PowerFlow".
#' @param Link.Limit A character string. The default is "Link.Limit".
#' @return A dataframe
