#' Flexible Removal method
#'
#' This Removal method pre-calculates the attack order and removes a fixed number of nodes
#'
#' @param g An igraph object representing a power-grid
#' @param DeltionOrder The order in which nodes will be targeted for deltion. This is a string vector
#' @param Name the variable which holds the edge/node names.
#' @param Target The element that will be attacked. A string, the default is Nodes. Can also be Edge.
#' @param Number The total number of targets to calulcate the order for
