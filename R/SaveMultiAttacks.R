#' Save attack simulations to folder
#'
#'When creating many attack simulations it can be conveniant to save the resulting graphs to a folder
#'    so that re-runs are not required if further analysis is needed. This function saves the
#'    results of AttackTheGrid, and also allows the process to be interrupted.
#'    When the process is started again after and interuption the function finds the last
#'    save attack and starts the simulation process from there.
#' @param g An igraph object representing a power grid.
#' @param AttackVectors A dataframe. This is the output of the MultiAttackOrder function. If you expect.
#'    to interrupt the function this dataframe should be saved or the random seed used to generate the dataset
#'    recorded.
#' @param folder the folder data will be saved to.
#' @param MinMaxComp See AttackTheGrid. Default is 0
#' @param TotalAttackRounds See AttackTheGrid. Default is 10
#' @param CascadeMode See AttackTheGrid. Default is set to FALSE
#' @param Demand the name of the node Load variable. A character string.
#' @param Generation the name of the node generation variable. A character string.
#' @param EdgeName the variable that holds the edge names, a character string.
#' @param VertexName the variable that holds the names of the nodes, to identify the slack ref. a character string
#' @param Net_generation the name that the net generation data for each node is held in
#' @param Target whether nodes or edges are being attacked
