#' Balance Power network
#'
#'Ensures that the demand and generation of the power network are balanced. This is used before power
#'   flow is calculated.

#' @param g An igraph object representing a power network. A character vector.
#' @param  DemandVar The variable in g that contains the demand of each node. A character vector.
#' @param GenerationVar The variable in g that contains the generation of each node. A character vector.
#' @param OutputVar The desired output variable for the balanced net power demand of each node.
#'    A character vector the default is set to "BalencedPower".
