#' Create Transmission Network
#'
#' This function creates the transmission matrix between the edges and the In and Out Nodes
#'
#' The function follows the method described in Pepyne 2007.
#'    It takes a graph an ouputs a matrix which has -1,0-1 values which describe the nominal direction of flow.
#'    The function is typically used in conjunction with the LinePropertiesMatrix function. The function
#'    is a key part of calculating ImpPTDF.
#'
#' @param g an igraph object with attribute of named edges. This is an igraph object
#' @param EdgeName The attribute name of the edges. This is a string
#' @param VertexName the variable that holds the names of the nodes. a character string.
