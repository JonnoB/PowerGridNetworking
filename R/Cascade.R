#' Calculate the effects of a cascade
#'
#' Iterates through the network removing edges until no edges are over the line limit and the network has stabilised.
#'
#' This is a recursive function that calls itself repeatedly until the cascade has come to a stop and the network has stabilised.
#'   The function produces a list of graphs showing each state of the cascade. This function is mostly used as part of the
#'   AttackTheGrid function.
#' @param NetworkList A list of power-grid networks.
#' @param Iteration The current iteration number
#' @param StopCascade The number of iterations when cascade will be forced to terminate. An integer, default is set to infinity.
#' @param Demand the name of the node Load variable. A character string.
#' @param Generation The name of the node generation variable. A character string.
#' @param EdgeName The variable that holds the edge names, a character string.
#' @param VertexName The variable that holds the names of the nodes, to identify the slack ref. a character string
#' @param Net_generation The name that the net generation data for each node is held in
#' @param power_flow A character string. This value indicates the name of the edge attribute that holds power flow, the default is "PowerFlow"
#' @param edge_limit A character string. This value indicates the name of the edge attribute that holds the edge limit, the default is "Link.Limit"
