\title{Make Strategy Adaptive}
\usage{
AdaptiveStrategyAttack(g, AttackStrategy, Target = "Nodes", Number = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{the netowrk which is being attacked}

\item{Nodes}{the Number of Nodes to Remove}

\item{seed}{the random number generator to use. This is optional}

\description{
This implements an attack strategy to be adaptive.
    This means that it will be re-evaluated every

\examples{
AdaptiveStrategyAttack <- function(g, AttackStrategy, Target = "Nodes", Number = 1)
