\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object. The graph representation of the network to be normalised}

\item{generation}{A character string. The node attribute containing the flow generation}

\item{demand}{A character string. The node attribute containing the flow demand}

\item{net_generation}{A character string. The node atribute containing the difference between demand and generation for 
the current parametrization}

\item{capacity}{A character string. The edge attribute containing the flow capacity of each edge}

\item{edge_name}{A character string. The edge attribbute containing the edge names}

\item{node_name}{A character string. The node attibute containing the node names}

\item{power_flow}{A character string. The name of the edge atribute that contains the flow data}
}

This function normalises the load across a DC power network.
