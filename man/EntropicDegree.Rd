\usage{
EntropicDegree(g, value = "Link.Limit", Scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{an igraph object}

\item{value}{The line feature to be used in calculating the entropic degree}

\item{Scale}{Should the values be scaled by multiplying by the log of the node degree}
}
\description{
Calculates the entropic degree of each node in the network using the edge feature of choice.
The default is the flow limit of the line.
